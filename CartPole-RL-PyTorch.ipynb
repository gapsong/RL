    "# Training RL to do Cartpole Balancing\n",

    "This notebooks is part of [AI for Beginners Curriculum](http://aka.ms/ai-beginners). It has been inspired by [official PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) and [this Cartpole Pytorch implementation](https://github.com/yc930401/Actor-Critic-pytorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use RL to train a model to balance a pole on a cart that can move left and right on horizontal scale. We will use [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/) environment to simulate the pole.\n",

When running the code online, you may need to make some tweaks to the code, as described [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/rendering-openai-gym-envs-on-binder-and-google-colab-536f99391cc7).\n",

    "We have seen two RL algorithms in this demo: simple policy gradient, and more sophisticated actor-critic. You can see that those algorithms operate with abstract notions of state, action and reward - thus they can be applied to very different environments.\n",

    "Reinforcement learning allows us to learn the best strategy to solve the problem just by looking at the final reward. The fact that we do not need labelled datasets allows us to repeat simulations many times to optimize our models. However, there are still many challenges in RL, which you may learn if you decide to focus more on this interesting area of AI.   "
